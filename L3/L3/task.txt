U3-5. Battle of the minds. The two student councils organizing the battle of the minds have decided to unite and create a shared question bank. 
The first line contains the name of the student council, followed by the questions (open-ended, multiple choice, or music-related) 
which include a feature, topic, difficulty level, author, question text, word count, number of answer choices, correct answer number, file name, 
file size, and points.

The battle of the minds questions can be open-ended, multiple choice with possible answer choices, or music-related. 
Create a class called "Question" (with properties such as topic (history, literature, etc.), difficulty level (1, 2, ..., 5),
author, question text, correct answer number, and points), which will be inherited by the "OpenQuestion" class (with the property of word count), 
"TestQuestion" class (with the property of number of answer choices), and "MusicQuestion" class (with properties such as file name and file size).

Tasks:

Find out who created the most music-related questions in each student council. Provide the name(s) of the author(s) and the number of questions.
Create a list of multiple choice questions for each student council by topic and number of answer choices.
Create a list of questions with a specified difficulty level N, including multiple choice and music-related questions, 
and provide complete information about them. The size of N is specified by the keyboard. Sort the list by topic and points."
