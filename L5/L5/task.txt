L5_5. Colored dots.
In a rectangular coordinate plane, there are n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) colored dots. 
By connecting the dots in groups of three, it is possible to form many triangles. 
The colors for which triangle formation is allowed are known. Create a program that, for each color, if possible, 
finds three dots that can be connected to form the largest equilateral triangles. 
Calculate the perimeters of the obtained triangles. Print the color name, coordinates, perimeter, or the word "nėra" (not available) or the word "negalima" (not possible).

Data:
• The text file U5a.txt contains data about the dots. 
The first line of the text file contains the number n. 
Following that, the colors and coordinates (x; y - integers) (-100 ≤ x, y ≤ 100) of n dots are listed line by line. 
The color name can consist of two words.
• The text file U5b.txt contains a list of colors and instructions. 
The colors are listed in a column, and next to each color name, there is the word "taip" (yes) if it is allowed, 
or the word "ne" (no) if it is not allowed.
