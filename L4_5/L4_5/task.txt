U4-5
A student is analyzing the suitability of cars for trips. The first line of the file contains the company name. 
Then there is data about the cars: brand, number of passengers that can fit in the car, and the amount of fuel consumed per 100 km. 
We have data for two companies that organize trips.

Find the most economical car for each company (consumes the least amount of fuel) and the maximum number of passengers that can fit in the largest car.
Compile a separate set of data for all cars from both companies that consume no more than the most fuel-efficient car per 100 km.
Sort the list of results in descending order of the number of passengers.
Remove from the list of results cars whose fuel consumption per 100 km is greater than the one specified on the keyboard.
