This program is designed to find the most suitable car for a trip (see task).
The data for the program is written in selected text files, for example: 
"Company1.txt" and "Company2.txt". The first line of the file is the company name. 
Next are the data about the cars: the brand, the number of passengers that fit in the car, the amount of space in the car, and the amount of fuel consumed for 100 km. 
We have the data of two companies that organize trips with cars.
 
The program is controlled by a graphical interface. 
The program does not work until the "Input files" button (which is in the "Program" menu) is clicked and two data files are selected, 
and the "Output file" button (which is in the "Program" menu) is clicked and a result file is selected to which the result data will be printed. 
After these actions, the following actions can be selected, which are in the "Actions" menu.
In the "Actions" menu, you can find the following actions:
By clicking on the "Most Economical Cars" button, you can find the most economical car of each company.
By clicking on the "Biggest cars" button, you can find the car of each company that can accommodate the most passengers.
By clicking on the "Form a new list from cars that uses less fuel than biggest car" button, you can find all cars of both companies 
that consume no more than 100km of fuel per biggest car and list them separately.
By clicking on the "Sort" button, you can sort the newly created list by the number of passengers, in descending order.
By entering a number (fuel consumption, 100 km) on the keyboard and clicking the "Remove cars that exceed entered fuel consumption" button, 
you can remove all cars in the newly created list whose fuel consumption exceeds this number.
In the "Help" menu, you can find the following actions:
By clicking on the "Task" button, you can find the entire task text in English.
By clicking on the "Instructions for user" button, you can find the complete user instruction.
